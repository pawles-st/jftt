# Formal Langauges and Translation Techniques

This course was dedicated to theoretical as well as practical aspects of lexing, parsing and translating source code.

List 1 - Implementing Finite Automaton and KMP matchers.\
List 2 - Learning Flex by implementing simple lexer programs and a reverse polish notation notation integer calculator.\
List 3 - Using Flex/Bison together to create a GF 1234577 infix modulo calculator with formula error detection. Similar calculator was implemented in Python.\
List 4 - Compiler project: Rust Lalrpop program to translate code written in a simple, imperative language with syntax similar to Ada into equivalent virtual machine code.
